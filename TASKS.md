## Features

### Top priority

* File handling

### Future ideas

* Remember the last column position when moving up/down in the way emacs does
* Allow variable tab length
* Allow multiple buffers
* Allow splitting the screen (use ncurses window functionality)
* Allow a buffer to have no lines?
* Completely separate rendering from backend

## Bux Fixes
