# text-editor
A text editor aiming to combine the best parts of editors such as emacs, vim & nano.

### About the project & its goals

This text editor should be mulitplatform and as open as possible.  
Every contribution, whether it's an improvement, an issue or just an idea is more than welcome.  
The main goal is to make it as useful as possible, taking the best parts from the best editors - emacs, vim & nano.  
It's still in a very early stage so it's not particularly useful (yet!).  
However, I do my best to keep moving the project forward, every contribution counts!

**Let's make text editing great again!**
